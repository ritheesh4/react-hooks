Rules of Hooks
---------------
"Only Cal lHooks at the Top Level"
Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions or ntested functions

"Only Call Hooks from React Functions"
Call them from whithin React functional components and not just any regualr
JavaScript function

useState
----------
- useState never automatically merge the data. You have to do that manually. For example dealing with array,
    you should use spread operator. Otherwise the entire data will be replaced. 
- The useState hook lets add state to functional components.
- In classes, the state is always and object.
- With the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an object.
- The useState hook returns an array with 2 elements.
- The frist element is the current value of the state, and the second elements is a state setter function.
- New state value depends on the previous state value? You can pass a function to the setter function.
- When dealing with objects or arryays, always make sure to spread your state varuable and then call the setter function.
useEffect
----------
- The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in functional components
- Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 
- useEffect with cleanup is really important. If we have added an event listener and we remove that component, it is really important to remove the event listener from there,
  otherwise the old event listener will keep listen and it would not work clean us we want.
